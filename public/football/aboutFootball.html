        <h1>What To Know About Football: <br/>
        Rules:</h1>
        <p>
            Football is an American sport that operates on a four quarter basis.
            Each quarter is composed of fifteen minutes. The clock runs consistently
            thoughout the game. The clock stops when one of the following happens:
            a player is injured, the player with the ball runs out of bounds, a 
            timeout is called (each team gets 3 for each half, two for overtime), 
            or the two minute warning. The two minute warning occurs when a play is
            not active, and the clock at the end of each half hits two minutes.
            The team who scores the most at the end wins. In a case where both teams
            scored the same and overtime ends, a tie occurs. Each drive consists of
            downs. At fourth down, a team can elect to kick a field goal, punt the ball,
            or go for the first down at the risk of turning the ball over.

        <h1>Common Penalties:</h1>
        <p>
            Offsides: A player on the offense is past the line of scrimmage.
            A 5 yard penalty occurs when this happens.<br/>
            Neutral Zone Infraction: A player on the defense is past the line of
            scrimmage. A 5 yard penalty occurs when this happens.<br/>
            False Start: A player on either side that is lined up moves after the
            ball is set. A 5 yard penalty occurs when this happens.<br/>
            Roughing The Passer: A defensive player uses excessive force either
            while the quarterback still has the ball, or especially after they don't.
            A 15 yard penalty occurs and a first down is automatically granted
            when this happens.<br/>
            Roughing The Kicker: A defensive player hit the kicker's planted leg.
            This penalty is only called when the ball is also not tipped.
            A 15 yard penalty occurs and a first down is automatically granted
            when this happens.<br/>
            Defensive Pass Interference: A defensive player prohibits the receiver's
            ability to catch the ball. This penalty only occurs if the defender
            is not playing the ball (i.e. looking at it and following it).
            This penalty places the ball at the spot of the foul and grants an
            automatic first down.<br/>
            Offensive Pass Interference: An offensive player prohibits the defender's
            ability to catch the ball. This penalty only occurs if the receiver
            is not playing the ball (i.e. looking at it and following it).
            A 10 yard penalty occurs when this happens.<br/>
            Holding: A player grabs another prohibiting them from engaging in the
            play. A 5 yard penalty occurs when this happens by an offensive player,
            and a 5 yard penalty and automatic first down occurs when this happens
            by a defensive player.<br/>
            Intentional Grounding: The quarterback either throws the ball near 
            no receiver to avoid a sack. they fail to throw it past the line of 
            scrimmage to avoid a sack, or they they throw the ball out of bounds 
            while still inside the pocket (in between the numbers) to avoid a sack.
            A 10 yard penalty occurs and the team loses a down when this happens.
            <br/><br/>

            Subjective Penalties:
            Facemask: This occurs when a player grabs the facemask of another player.
            Unnecessary Roughness: This occurs when a player uses an unnecessary
            amount of force to get the ball.
            Unsportsmanlike Conduct: This occurs when a player conducts an act that
            is not generally accepted (i.e. taunting).<br/><br/>

        <h1>Scoring Points:</h1>
        <p>
            1 point:
            This can only be scored after a touchdown. A team can elect to go for
            an extra point by kicking a field goal. If successful, they get one point.<br/>

            2 points:
            This can be earned through either a two point conversion or a safety.

            Two Point Conversion: This happens when a team elects to go for two 
            instead of an extra point. If the defense acquires the ball on this play
            and scores, they are awared the two points.

            Safety: This happens when a team is tackled for a loss inside their 
            own endzone. The team on defense is awarded the points and then receives 
            the ball via a punt.<br/>

            3 points:
            This can only be earned through kicking an independent field goal. If
            a team successfully places a ball between the uprights from their location,
            they get awarded three points.<br/>

            6 points:
            This occurs any time a player crosses into the opposite endzone with 
            the ball. Whether it occurs by a team while on defense or on offense,
            they are awarded six points unless it is a two point conversion.<br/>

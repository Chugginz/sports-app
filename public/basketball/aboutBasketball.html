                What to know about Basketball: <br/>
            About the sport:</h1>
            <p>
                Basketball is the only major sport strictly of U.S. orgin and it was 
                created by James Naismith in 1891. It started off as two peach baskets 
                as on a pole on each side of the court and a ball made from panels of 
                leather stitched together with a rubber bladder inside and a cloth 
                lining for support. Fun the fact the first game (not really but the 
                test game) only one point was scored and it was a midcourt shot.
                <br><br/>

            <h1>Rules of the game:</h1>
            <p>
                There are alot of rules to the game but there are the main five that 
                everyone follows. Must be played with a light ball(Ex - a basketball);
                Must be handled with the hands; No running with the ball; no player 
                being restricted from getting the ball when it is in play; No personal 
                contact: and you must score on a horizontal elevated goal.<br/>
                How to move with the ball: A player may pass or bounce (or driblle the ball)
                to their teamate so they can potentially try and get a score.<br/>
                Fouling: A foul is committed whenever a player makes such contact with an 
                opponent as to put him at a disadvantage. if a player is fouled while trying 
                to shoot and the shot is good, the point is rewarded. If a foul is committed 
                against a player who is not shooting, then his team is awarded either the 
                possession of the ball or a free throw if the other team is in a penalty 
                situation.Infractions such as unsportsmanlike conduct or grasping the rim 
                are technical fouls, which award to the opposition a free throw and 
                possession of the ball. Overly violent fouls are called flagrant fouls 
                and also result in free throws and possession for the opposition. Players are 
                allowed a set number of personal fouls per game (six in the NBA, five in most 
                other competitions) and are removed from the game when the foul limit 
                is reached.<br/>
                Penalties: When the team is awarded a penalty they are allowed to score some
                points on the free throw line. If the basket was made when the player was fouled, 
                then the basket counts and one free throw is awarded. If the basket was not made, 
                then either two free throws or three are awarded.<br><br/>
            </p>
            <h1>Scoring Points:</h1>
            <p>
                For 1 Point:
                You can get 1 point for each free throw you get and these are usually awrded when 
                the team gets a penalty.<br/>

                For 2 Points:
                You can shoot anywhere in the paint or inside the half-circle. This where most 
                points are scored during games and is also one of the challenging scoring areas 
                of basketball in general.<br/>

                For 3 Points: 
                These are only scored from the three point line and beyond. These types of baskets
                get the most hype of any crowd since it is one of the toughest shots to make espacially 
                when your in motion. Sometimes games are decided when there is little time remaining and 
                one player decides to take a hal court shot to try to win the game.<br/>

<h1>
    What to know about Baseball: <br/>
About the sport:</h1>
<p>
    Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, of nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding.
    The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries 
    to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its
    players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective 
    of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.
     A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). 
     The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.

<h1>Rules of the game:</h1>

    Innings & outs
    An “out” is when an offensive player must leave the field after:
    
    Being tagged by a ball in play
    Not making it to the base or home plate before a member of the opposing team with the ball in their glove does
    Swinging three times at a pitch and missing all three times
    Once the offensive team gets three outs, it’s their turn to play defense. An inning ends after both teams have played both offense and defense, and each team gets three outs.
    Each batter has three chances to hit a ball that’s pitched to them. If they swing and miss, or they don’t swing on a pitch that’s ruled fair by the umpire, it’s called a strike. 
    After three strikes, the team receives an “out.”
    There are lines drawn on the field that connect the bases. The lines leading from home plate to first base, and from home plate to third base are used to determine whether a ball is in play. If the ball is hit between the base lines, it’s in play. If a ball is hit outside of the base lines, it’s called a foul.

If a batter hits a foul on the first or second pitch, it counts as a strike. If a batter hits a foul on the third pitch, it counts as a foul, and the batter is allowed another pitch.

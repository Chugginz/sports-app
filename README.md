Web Dev Project

Updating this as I go.

3/9/22
Added all foundational files. Most html files needed, server.js and app.js, minimal SQL for the moment, as well as the files needed to interact with databases. I've added Database, Models, public, public/images, public/football, and public/rugby 
for folders at the moment for organizational purposes. All html files were "html:5" initialized and have been properly/temporarily titled.

Created and updated the index.html file. Now users are introduced by the logo of
Sports App and a welcome page. Created the page explaining football. Also added
a home.html file, a favicon, a login.html and created messaging folder in public.
Added the page detailing the rules of football as well as a nav menu to get between
different pages. Starting working on using an ESPN api to get scores for a game
for /football/scores.html with the file /football.js in /Models.
